Plotting with noveltree
=======================


Applying a story structure model
--------------------------------

If you want to divide a story into stages according to a structure model
(e.g. the *Three Act Model*, or the *Save The Cat* beatsheet), just
insert the stages between the regular scenes at the beginning of each
phase. This gives you color-coded subheadings in the tree view.

With the `nv_templates plugin 
<https://peter88213.github.io/nv_templates/>`__ you can
load pre-made story structure models from Markdown template files, and
you can save the story structure of your project for reuse.


Defining Arcs
-------------

*noveltree* provides *arcs* as a powerful and flexible concept for
plotting.

“Arc” can mean a variety of things: Narrative strand, thread, character
arc, storyline, sequence of cause and effect, sequence of setup and
payoff, and so on. You can think of an arc as a line on which turning
points are arranged that characterize the progression of the story.
These turning points can be assigned to scenes to indicate the scene’s
relevance to the plot.

-  *noveltree* lets you define any number of arcs.
-  Any number of scenes can be assigned to each arc.
-  Any number of arcs can be assigned to each scene.
-  Each arc can contain any number of turning points.
-  Each turning point can be assigned to exactly one scene.

The association of scenes and turning points is shown in the “Plot”
column of the tree view.

You can use arcs to establish named connections between scenes, such as
*setup -> payoff*, so you can keep track of this relationship even if
the scenes are far away from each other.
