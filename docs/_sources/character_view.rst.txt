"Sticky note"

When the "sticky note" of a character contains text, an "N" is
displayed in the tree view as a reminder.

.. note::
   The "sticky notes" are only for working with *noveltree*.
   They are not meant to be exported into a document.
   However, they appear in the `character list`_.
