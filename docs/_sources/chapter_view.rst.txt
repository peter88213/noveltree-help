Chapter/part properties
=======================

The Chapter/part properties view opens in the right pane
when you select a chapter or a part in the tree.
You can edit the properties of the selected chapter or part.

.. hint::
   You can change any chapter into a part or vice versa via the **Change
   Level** entry in the context menu, the **Part** menu, or the **Chapter** 
   menu.

Title and description
---------------------

Title and description are displayed in an editable "index card".

The editing of the title can be completed by pressing the ``Enter`` key.
Changes to the description are applied when the mouse is clicked
anywhere outside the text input field.

.. note::
   Depending on your `Book settings <book_view.html#auto-numbering>`_, 
   *noveltree* might overwrite the title the next time the tree is refreshed.
   Thus, you don't need to edit the capter/part title, if auto numbering is
   activated and the selected chapter or part is not excluded from 
   auto numbering (see below).

_`Do not auto-number` this chapter/part
   If this checkbox is ticked, the selected chapter or part will be excluded
   from `auto numbering <book_view.html#auto-numbering>`_, and the title
   you enter manually will persist.
