Title and description
---------------------

Title and description are displayed in an editable "index card".

The editing of the title can be completed by pressing the ``Enter`` key.
Changes to the description are applied when the mouse is clicked
anywhere outside the text input field.


"Sticky note"
-------------

The yellow text area is for notes. Changes are applied
when the mouse is clicked anywhere outside the text input field.

When the "sticky note" of a stage contains text, an "N" is
displayed in the tree view as a reminder.

.. note::
   The "sticky notes" are only for working with *noveltree*.
   They are not meant to be exported into a document.
