Title and description are displayed in an editable "index card". 

The editing of the title can be completed by pressing the ``Enter`` key. 
Changes to the description are applied when the mouse is clicked 
anywhere outside the text input field. 


"Sticky note"
-------------

The yellow text area is for notes. Changes are applied 
when the mouse is clicked anywhere outside the text input field.

When the "sticky note" of a character contains text, an "N" is 
displayed in the tree view as a reminder.

.. note::
   The "sticky notes" are only for working with *noveltree*.
   They are not meant to be exported into a document.
   However, they appear in the `character list`_.
