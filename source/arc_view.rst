Title and description
---------------------

Title and description are displayed in an editable "index card".

The editing of the title can be completed by pressing the ``Enter`` key.
Changes to the description are applied when the mouse is clicked
anywhere outside the text input field.


Short name
----------

Be sure to enter a short name to be displayed as a reference in the tree.
A single character like "A", "B", "C" is recommended.

Section assignments
-------------------

The number of sections that belong to the selected arc is shown
below the "Short name" entry. The assignments can be made in the
`section properties view <section_view.html#plot>`__.
You can unlink all sections from the selected arc at once by
clicking on the **Clear section assignments** button.

.. hint::
   A convenient way to manage and keep track of section assignments is 
   offered by the `noveltree_matrix plugin 
   <https://peter88213.github.io/noveltree_matrix/>`__.
