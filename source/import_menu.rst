This will open a pop-up window with a list containing previously
exported ODT documents that can be re-imported, thus updating the
current project.

-  The document types and dates are shown.
-  Documents that are newer than the project file are highlighted in
   green.
-  Documents that cannot be imported because they are open in
   LibreOffice/OpenOffice are highlighted in red.
-  You can update the project from a document either by double-clicking
   on the list entry, or by selecting the document and clicking on the
   **Import** button.
-  You can delete documents by selecting them and clicking on the
   **Discard** button.
-  After closing a listed document in LibreOffice while the *Exported
   documents* window is open, you can click on the **Refresh view**
   button.
-  If the **Discard document after import** checkbox is checked, a
   document will be deleted after re-import. This may help to avoid
   confusion about changes made with *noveltree* and
   OpenOffice/LibreOffice.

   .. note::
   	Documents with split sections are always automatically
   	discarded after re-import.
