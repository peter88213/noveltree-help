"Sticky note"
-------------

The yellow text area is for notes. Changes are applied
when the mouse is clicked anywhere outside the text input field.

When the "sticky note" of a section contains text, an "N" is
displayed in the tree view as a reminder. If the branch of a chapter
with sections containing notes is collapsed, the "N" is displayed
in the chapter row.

.. note::
   The "sticky notes" are only for working with *noveltree*.
   They are not meant to be exported into a document.
   However, they appear in the `section list`_.
